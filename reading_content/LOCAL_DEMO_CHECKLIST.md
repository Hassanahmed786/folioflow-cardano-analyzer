### **üé§ PRESENTATION SCRIPT**

#### **Opening (30 seconds)**
> "Hi, I'm [Name] and this is FolioFlow - the first AI-powered Cardano portfolio analyzer. If you hold ADA, you need this."

#### **Problem Statement (1 minute)**
> "Cardano users have billions in TVL but zero sophisticated analysis tools. They connect wallets, see basic balances, but get no insights about spending patterns, tax implications, or risk assessment."

#### **Solution Demo (5 minutes)**
> "Watch this. [Connect wallet] Real CIP-30 integration. [Start analysis] Our AI analyzes real blockchain data via Blockfrost. [Show results] Look at this - portfolio health score, transaction patterns, tax intelligence, risk assessment - all powered by Azure OpenAI."

#### **Business Model (2 minutes)**
> "Here's the key - this becomes a paid service through Masumi Network. Users pay 5 ADA for analysis. Conservative projections show $18K monthly revenue by month 12. But here's the real opportunity - agent-to-agent economy. Other AI agents pay us for portfolio data."

#### **Closing (1 minute)**
> "We're not just building a tool - we're building the portfolio intelligence layer for Cardano. The prototype works today. The market is huge. The revenue model is proven. This is how we scale with Cardano's growth."

### **‚ùì Q&A PREPARATION**

**Q: "How do you ensure data privacy?"**
A: "Zero private key storage. CIP-30 standard means users control all data. We only analyze public transaction data."

**Q: "What's your competitive advantage?"**
A: "First mover in AI-powered Cardano analysis, Masumi monetization, and we're building for the agent economy."

**Q: "How will you acquire users?"**
A: "Launch on Masumi marketplace, partner with major Cardano wallets, content marketing in crypto communities."

**Q: "What's your go-to-market strategy?"**
A: "Freemium model - 1 free analysis per wallet, then paid tiers. Target tax season for premium services."

**Q: "How scalable is this?"**
A: "Cloud-native architecture, API-first design, Masumi handles payments. We scale with Cardano adoption."
